# Nintendo-Strategic-Information-Systems-Initiative

This project presents a detailed examination of a hypothetical Strategic Information Systems (SIS) initiative for Nintendo. It outlines a comprehensive SIS planning process and includes an industry analysis, firm analysis, and customer life-cycle review. Additionally, the project proposes a strategy for creating and capturing value and concludes with a feasibility analysis of the initiative.

SIS Initiative: Nintendo to develop an official mobile emulator app that allows users to play legacy titles from consoles such as the DS, NES, and Game Boy. By leveraging modern smartphone capabilities and emulation technology, the platform would offer a legal, user-friendly alternative to unofficial emulators and ROMs. The emulator would include features such as cloud saves, Bluetooth controller support, and an online store for purchasing classic titles. This initiative aims to preserve Nintendoâ€™s rich gaming history while generating new revenue streams, expanding its mobile presence, and reintroducing legacy games to the next generation of gamers.

The purpose of this project is to apply SIS concepts in a real-world business context and explore how strategic information systems can be leveraged to achieve competitive advantage. 

This hypothetical project provided hands-on experience in strategic planning, critical thinking, and aligning IT solutions with business objectives. It also deepend my understanding of how organizations analyze their environment, assess internal capabilities, and make informed decisions about future innovation.
